This package provides a set of procedures for 

a. simulation and estimation of some spatial and spatio-temporal random fields using standard likelihood and a likelihood approximation method called composite likelihood and 

b. prediction using best linear unbiased prediction.  Spatio (temporal) bivariate data estimation involves estimation of both regression and covariance parameters. 

Gaussian and some non Gaussian Random fields can be analyzed using the `Geomodels` package. Among them gamma, Weibull, log-Gaussian, binomial, negative binomial, skewGaussian, StudenT and circular random fields can be analyzed.
