## Features

This package provides a set of procedures for

- Simulation
- Estimation

of some spatial and spatio-temporal random fields using standard likelihood and a likelihood approximation method called composite likelihood and

- Prediction

using best linear unbiased prediction.

Spatio (temporal) bivariate data estimation involves estimation of both regression and covariance parameters.  Gaussian and some non Gaussian Random fields can be analyzed using the Geomodels package. Among them,

- Gamma
- Weibull
- Log-Gaussian
- Binomial
- Negative binomial
- SkewGaussian
- StudenT and 

Also, circular random fields can be analyzed.
